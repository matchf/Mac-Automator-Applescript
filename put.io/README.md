put.io.add.magnet.service.workflow

1 - Download & put workflow file on /Users/"YourUser"/Library/Services;

2 - Create a SERVICE keyboard shortcut for the workflow You just downloaded (nice tutorial on http://www.macworld.com/article/1139829/shortcutservices.html);

3 - Open the web page where You want to collect the magnets on safari;

4 - Just press the keyboard shortcut You created on step 2 and all the magnets on the webpage will be automatically added to your put.io account.


Edit the workflow and change the variable flgList to TRUE if you want to choose what magnets send to put.io, or FALSE to send all magnets to put.io without prompt.

Feel free to change/adapt/copy the workflow as you please.
